# EDA-with-Epicurious-Dataset
In my project, I performed comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the EpiRecipes dataset from Kaggle. This involved handling missing, duplicate, and incorrect data, followed by visualizing key trends and insights. The project showcased my ability to derive actionable findings from data, enhancing decision-making.


To address the absence of preparation times in the dataset, I created a new column, 'Prep-Time,' based on the calorie content of each recipe. Recipes with fewer than 200 calories have a prep time of 5 to 10 minutes. Those with 200 to 500 calories take 15 to 30 minutes, while recipes with 500 to 800 calories require 30 to 60 minutes. Lastly, recipes exceeding 800 calories typically take 60 to 120 minutes. This approach fills a significant gap in the dataset and enhances its usability.

## Key Insight
1) Conclusion: The Top 10 Ingredients in Higly Rated Recipes are :-
  Pastry Dough
  Turkey Stock
  Simple Syrup
  Salsa Verde
  Turkey Giblet Stock
  Pizza Dough
  Root Vegetable Gratin
  Vegetable Stock
  Chicken Stock
  Horseradish Cream

2) Conclusion:
  As according to my analysis Overall, the correlation of 0.95 suggests a negligible relationship between preparation time and recipe ratings. This means that changes in preparation time are unlikely to predict       or influence the ratings given by users for the recipes.
  we can also use scatter plot, regression, hypothesis(person) to show these correlation between the preparation Time and rating.
